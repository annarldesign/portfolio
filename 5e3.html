					<p>Recordings were made at different angles, elevations and distances around a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_head_recording ">dummy head microphone.</a> These recording were made with and without the hear-through audio headset on the dummy head microphone. Binaural room impulse responses (BRIR) were then created. BRIRs represent the impulse repose at a persons ear when they hear a sound from a specific angle and elevation, these were used to analyse the hear-through device in Python. The main aim here was to see if the head-set would alter any of the necessary cues needed to localise sound sources.

						<p>Sound source localisation in the vertical plane (elevated sound sources) relies largely on cues which are produced by oneâ€™s own ears and upper body, meaning it is quite challenging to accurately analyse the localisation of elevated sound sources using the dummy head microphone. As subjective listening tests are recognised as being a reliable way of measuring the quality and performance of any audio system, it was decided to carry out subjective listening tests. The primary objective of these listening tests assessed sound source localisation accuracy and the subsequent impact, if any, of the headset by comparing sound source localization with the headset, to natural hearing results.
