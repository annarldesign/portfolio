			<h2 id="content">Aim</h2>
<p>The scope of this internship project dealt with different ways of rendering spatial audio that
could be employed to improve their current research and generate a more immersive and realistic user experience.
 </p>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
					<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Detailed research into binaural audio, signal processing, spatial audio rendering and ear anatomy was carried out to get a background into how people hear, why they hear what they hear and how to recreate realistic audio recordings.
</p><p>
	This information was used to develop binaural audio with different acoustic attributes such as room impulse responses, apparent source width and changing decibel level in Python. Different functions were developed for the different audio attributes.
</p>

<p>

</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
					<h3>Example of Rendered Audio</h3>
					<p>This audio created using a Python funciton that allowed the user input an audio signal and the direction the audio is coming from. In this sample the audio is travelling around the back of the listner.
				</p>

				</div>

			</div>
				<h2 id="content">User Testing</h2>
				<p>The audio that was developed was used in subjective listening tests which were designed in accordance with International Telecommunication Recommendations, as subjective listening tests are recognised as being one of the most reliable ways of measuring the quality of any audio system. </p>

<p>It is imperative that the correct audio samples are used in listening tests. Harvard sentences were used in these subjective listening tests. These sentences were originally developed during WWII in research to improve communication in combat aircrafts, but now are widely used in the testing of telecommunication devices or by speech scientists and engineers. The sentences are phonetically balanced leading to the frequency of the sentences matching that of the natural language.

					<h2 id="content">What I learned</h2>

				<ul>
					<li><b>Taught myself Python.</b> Initially the audio was to be created in MATLAB. However, as Python is more widely used, and is free in comparison to MATLAB’s licence, it was decided that I would learn Python.

		</li>
		<li>Taught myself how to use <b>Blender</b>.
					<li><b>Formal research, paper formatting & data presentation</b>
		</li>
		<li>Developed <b>knowledge of virtual reality audio</b>.

</li>


			<li>Improved <b>presentation & communication skills</b> through regular progress update meetings and presentations for stakeholders with different levels of knowledge into binaurla audio. Here I learned to adapt my presentations for different audiences, depending on their depth of knowledge in the area.
